## Subsystem Heatmap

Using R, this visualization illustrates the distribution of functional subsystems among the analyzed  **E. coli** strains. It emphasizes the variations observed in key areas such as antibiotic resistance, metabolic processes, and the presence of mobile genetic elements. 

This information is crucial for understanding the diversity and adaptability of these strains in different environments.
