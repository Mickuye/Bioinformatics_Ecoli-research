ðŸ§¬ Comparative genomic analysis of multiple E. coli strains to investigate the evolution of antibiotic resistance, including assembly, annotation, resistance profiling, and phylogenetics.


## Evolution of Antibiotic Resistance in Escherichia coli
A Comparative Genomic Study

**Overview**
This project investigates the evolution of antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli using a comparative genomic approach. Utilizing multiple strains, I assembled, annotated, and analyzed bacterial genomes to identify genomic changes, resistance-associated genes, and phylogenetic relationships. 

What started as a mini research project within course-based modules has since expanded into a more comprehensive research publication (currently in progress) involving 28 E. coli strains.

 **Objectives**

-	Perform genome assembly and quality control on raw E. coli data.
-	Conduct functional annotation and resistance profiling.
-	Compare strains to identify resistance-associated genes.
-	Construct phylogenetic trees to explore evolutionary patterns.
-	Generate visualizations (heatmaps, resistance maps, strain trees).

**Tools & Technologies**

-	Genome Assembly & QC: Unicycler, Pilon, QUAST
-	Pipelines: BV-BRC, Samtools, Trim Galore, Bandage
-	Functional Annotation: BV-BRC, NCBI databases
-	Data Analysis & Visualization: R
-	Results Management: Excel, CSV, PNG

**KEY RESULTS**
- High-quality genome assemblies were generated for multiple strains of E. coli.
- Antibiotic resistance profiling revealed specific resistance patterns unique to each strain.
- A heatmap visualization displayed the presence of resistance genes across the strains.
- A phylogenetic tree illustrated the evolutionary divergence among the resistant strains.
- Functional subsystems were identified, highlighting the genetic factors that contribute to antibiotic resistance.

**IMPACT**

This project offers insights into the genomic mechanisms underlying antibiotic resistance, a pressing global health challenge. By integrating assembly, annotation, and comparative analysis, it demonstrates a full bioinformatics workflow for microbial genomics research.

**RESEARCH PUBLICATION**

-	Expansion to include 28 E. coli strains (publication in preparation).  
-	Conduct a deeper functional analysis of resistance gene clusters.  
-	Integrate machine learning models for resistance prediction (planned).
