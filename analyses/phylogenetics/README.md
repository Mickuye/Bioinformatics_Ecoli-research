### Phylogenetic Analysis  

This section contains the phylogenetic analysis of the *Escherichia coli* strains.  

- **phylogenetic_tree.png**  
  Visual representation of the evolutionary relationships among the strains.  
  Two additional *E. coli* strains were included to ensure the tree displayed branching structure.
  
- **phylogenetic_tree.tre**  
  Newick formatted tree file that can be loaded into phylogenetic visualization tools (e.g., iTOL, FigTree, MEGA) for reproducibility and further analysis.  

**Procedure**
- Genome sequences were aligned.  
- A maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was generated.  
- Results are provided as both an image and a Newick tree file for clarity and reproducibility.
