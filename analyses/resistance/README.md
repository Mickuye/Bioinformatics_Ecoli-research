### Antibiotic Resistance Analysis (ARM)  

This section explores the presence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes in the E. coli strains.

  Summary of methodology and results used to identify AMR genes.
  
- **E-1 (SRR3951549) Antimicrobial Resistance Genes.pdf**  
  Detailed resistance gene profile for sample SRR3951549.
  
- **E-2 (SRR11094155) Antimicrobial Resistance Genes.pdf**  
  Detailed resistance gene profile for sample SRR11094155.  

**Procedure**

- Resistance genes were identified using the BV-BRC pipeline.  
- Results provide insights into antibiotic resistance mechanisms across different strains.
